# Metagenome Analysis 

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files, scripts, and documentation for conducting a metagenome analysis. The project focuses on analyzing raw sequencing reads to assemble, binning, and taxonomic assignment.

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following folders:


### Folder Descriptions

- **`reads/`**  
  Contains raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format. Due to size constraints, these files are stored on an external platform (e.g., Google Drive). The download links will be provided below.

- **`trimmed/`**  
  Contains quality-trimmed reads after preprocessing. Stored externally along with the raw reads.

- **`fastqc/`**  
  Includes FastQC reports for assessing the quality of raw reads.

- **`results/`**  
  Contains the final results, including:
  - **Assembly files**: Contigs and scaffolds in FASTA format.
  - **MaxBin**: Obtain Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) from the metagenomic assembly.
  - **CheckM**: Quality control metrics such as completeness, contamination for MAGs.
  - **TAXONOMY_MAGs**: Taxonomic assignments and visualizations with Krona.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Ensure the following software is installed:
- **FastQC**: For quality control of raw and trimmed reads.
- **Trimmomatic**: For read trimming and filtering.
- **MetaSPAdes**: For metagenome assembly.
- **MaxBin**: For metagenome binning.
- **CheckM**: For quality check of MAGs.
- **Kraken2**: For taxonomic classification.
- **Krona**: For visualization.

### Data Access
Raw-trimmed reads and assembly files are too large to store in this repository. Download them using the following links:
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/10XwPEKgquAP9sZEEAjOenZDISo7htNKY)

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Quality Control (FastQC)**
   - Assess raw read quality using FastQC.
   - Check sequence quality scores, GC content, and overrepresented sequences

2. **Read Trimming (Trimmomatic)**
   - Trim adapters and low-quality bases.
   - Remove short reads (<50 bp).

3. **Assembly (MetaSPAdes)**
   - Perform metagenome assembly.
   - Generate contigs and scaffolds.

4. **Binning (MaxBin)**
   - Cluster contigs into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).
   - Extract potential microbial genomes from the assembly.
     
5. **CheckM (Quality Control of MAGs)**
   - Calculate completeness and contamination metrics for each MAG.
   - Generate detailed quality reports for each bin

7. **Taxonomic Classification (Kraken2)**
   - Classify reads taxonomically using reference databases.
   - Determine community composition.

8. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - Generate Krona plots for interactive visualization of taxonomic composition.
   - Create summary reports of assembly statistics.
